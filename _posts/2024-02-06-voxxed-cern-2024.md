## Introduction

The conference was conducted in English. A noteworthy point: most talks were around 45 minutes, significantly shorter than those at Devoxx, which can range from 1 hour to 3 hours. This made some presentations feel somewhat rushed.

## AI, LLM

Targeting Artificial Intelligence enthusiasts, here's a start!

Need a primer on LLMs and Generative AI? Check out this link for a quick introduction: [Financial Times on Generative AI](https://ig.ft.com/generative-ai/).

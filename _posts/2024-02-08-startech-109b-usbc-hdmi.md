## Purpose of this page 

List the monitor, resolutions and OS that let me use this adapter.  

## Reference

* The source page by the StarTech : [USB-C to Dual-HDMI Adapter, 4K 60Hz, PD - USB-C Display Adapters - Display & Video Adapters - StarTech.com](https://www.startech.com/en-us/display-video-adapters/109b-usbc-hdmi)
* The [data sheet](https://media.startech.com/cms/pdfs/109b-usbc-hdmi_datasheet.pdf) tells us that the Chipset ID is DisplayLink - DL6950

## Monitors

No 4K monitor at home but I have

* ASUS
* IIyama

## Windows 10

Works out of the box on a system on which :

* I am not an administrator
* I cannot install any drivers

So... That's pretty cool !  
I can set frequency higher than 60Hz, upto 144 Hz (the maximum of my ASUS monitor)
